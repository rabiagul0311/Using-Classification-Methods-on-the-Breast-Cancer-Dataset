# Using-Classification-Methods-on-the-Breast-Cancer-Dataset

The dataset consists of 569 patients with either ‘Malignant’ or ‘Benign’ breast
lesions. 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of the breast mass.
My objective was to perform classification on the dataset to predict the
diagnosis of each sample from its features. I evaluated the classification performance of two well-known classifiers: bayes
classifier and support vector machines (SVM).
